            <p class="lb_text">
                Gray works as an apprentice at his grandpa Saibara's forge. He resents how difficult it is to work under his grandpa's supervision and doesn't like the rural lifestyle that Saibara enjoys. Gray does enjoy the metalsmithing craft, but feels that nothing he does meets Saibara's unrealistic expectations. He's discouraged, mopey, and could use a good cheering up.

            <p class="lb_text">
                A natural wanderer, Cliff moved from place to place in search of somewhere to belong. When you first move to Mineral Town, Cliff lives at the inn at night and hides in the church during the day, avoiding social interaction with the town residents. Carter is worried about the shy hermit and hopes that maybe you can become friends with Cliff. He won't talk much at first, but as you raise your friendship with Cliff he'll become more talkative.

                During Autumn of your first year, an opportunity appears that could give Cliff a purpose in life by working at Duke's winery. It's up to you to invite Cliff to participate. If you keep it to yourself, Cliff will leave Mineral Town on Winter 29 of your first year.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Marie manages the Mineral Town library in the northwest corner of town. She's a bit quiet, much like the books she watches over. Her dad, Basil, has written many books about the creatures and plants that live around the village, so Marie stores them at the library. Marie loves it when there are visitors at the empty library, as she can then share her books with someone else.

                Marie was named Mary in the original English adaptation of the GBA game.

            <p class="lb_text">
                Kai is a seasonal visitor to Mineral Town. He'll come to town on Summer 1 and then leave on Fall 1. During the summer, Kai will open his Beach Cafe on the beach, where you can buy food to eat, such as Roasted Corn and Pizza. At night he is a guest at Dudley's inn. Kai doesn't have a quarrel with anyone, though Rick has a personal beef against Kai.

                The challenge of marrying Kai is his three-season absence from the game. While he is not available in town, Kai's friendship and love levels are paused. He cannot gain or lose affection unless he is physically residing in Mineral Town.
