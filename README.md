The game I chose was Story of Seasons, a cute farming sim from nintendo.

For this assigment I decided to work alone and thus only had to do it on one video game. Instead of explaining the game in detail I took characters from the game and gave each of them little bios. 

I decided to give each sprite the illusion of an animation from before and after you hover along with changing the bumper to make the changes pop even more. 

I wanted a cutesy style and even used the same backdrop the wiki has.
